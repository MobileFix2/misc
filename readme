Various files in this repo.

1. phoneresizer

Description: A script to resize all images in a folder for your phone/digital frame screen.

Requirements: Requires imagemagick to be installed on the system (apt-get install imagemagick). Place the file phoneresizer under /usr/local/bin (or someother entry in $PATH)

Usage: cd into the folder, and run 

  phoneresizer <longerside> <shortersize> [-cbz]

  phoneresizer 480 320

480/320 represent the longer shorter side on the screen. Two directories will be created: portrait and landscape. Images would be moved in there depending on their resolution, and they will be resized to the specified size.

  phoneresizer 480 320 -cbz

This will create cbz files from the two generated directories (and delete the directories).
